                    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
                    <h3>Chicken Tetrazzini:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>one 3-pound rotisserie chicken, meat pulled and shredded</li>
                            <li>1 pound cooked egg noodles (I like the Alberto’s brand)</li>
                            <li>1 pound sliced mushrooms, sautéed</li>
                            <li>3–4 cups tetrazzini sauce (see below)</li>
                            <li>1/4 cup Parmesan cheese</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>Tetrazzini Sauce:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
                            <li>1/3 cup flour</li>
                            <li>2 cups milk or cream (I used 1 cup heavy whipping cream and 1 cup whole milk, but I think half and half would also work)</li>
                            <li>1 1/2 cups chicken broth (more as needed)</li>
                            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt (to taste)</li>
                            <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Prep: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare the ingredients – pull the chicken, cook the noodles, sauté the mushrooms.</li>
                        <li>Sauce: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until incorporated. Cook for a few minutes to remove the floury taste. Slowly add the milk and broth, a little bit at a time, whisking after each addition until you get a nice, smooth, thickened sauce. Season with salt and stir in the wine. Taste and adjust – more salt, more wine, more broth to thin the sauce, etc.</li>
                        <li>Assemble: Toss the noodles with about a cup of sauce. In a greased 9×13 pan, layer: sauced-up noodles, mushrooms, half of sauce, chicken, remaining half of sauce, and Parmesan.</li>
                        <li>Bake: Bake for 30 minutes until melty and bubbly. Broil for 5 minutes to get the top browned. Season with salt and pepper to taste for serving. YUM-O.</li>
